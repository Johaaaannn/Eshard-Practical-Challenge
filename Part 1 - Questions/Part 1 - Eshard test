# ðŸ§© Part 1 â€“ Short Knowledge Questions

---

### 1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a bind mount and a volume in Docker?

A **bind mount** maps an **existing directory** from the host system into the container.  
A **Docker volume** is managed directly by Docker and stored in `/var/lib/docker/volumes`, providing safer and more portable data management.

### 2. How do you configure a static IP address in Linux (Ubuntu)?

- During OS installation, or manually:
  - On older versions: `/etc/network/interfaces` (deprecated since Ubuntu 18.04).
  - On recent versions: edit `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml`, then apply changes with:
    ```bash
    sudo netplan apply
    ```

### 3. What does `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP` do?

Blocks **all incoming TCP connections** on port **22**, making **SSH inaccessible** from outside.

---

### 4. Whatâ€™s the use of `/etc/resolv.conf`?

Stores **DNS configuration**, including name servers and resolver options.

---

### 5. In Docker, whatâ€™s the difference between the `--network=host` and `bridge` modes?

- `--network=host`: the container shares the **hostâ€™s network stack**, with no network isolation (same IP and ports).
- `bridge` (default): the container has its **own virtual network interface** with internal IP, gateway, and DNS.  
  Ports must be explicitly exposed using the `-p` option.

---

### 6. What are common ways to harden SSH access?

- Use **SSH key-based authentication** (disable password authentication).  
- **Disable root login** and restrict allowed users (`AllowUsers`).  
- Enable **Fail2ban** to protect against brute-force attacks.

---

### 7. You find a file with 777 permissions in a production container. What would you do?

- Investigate **why** the file has these permissions.  
- If authorized, **reduce them** to the minimum necessary (`chmod 644` or `600`).  
- **Notify** the service owner and manager for proper follow-up and security review.

---

### 8. Describe what a reverse proxy does and name one example.

A **reverse proxy** forwards client requests to backend servers while exposing a single public interface.  
It can handle **SSL/TLS termination**, **load balancing**, and enhance **security** by hiding internal infrastructure.  
**Example:** Nginx.
